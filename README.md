# crypto-for-kitties

Doesn't work yet, but we're getting there!

Crypto for kitties is a web-based crypto miner that will allow people to keep a tab open and mine some coins for needy kitties. Once we have a decent stockpile, I'll donate everything to the Humane Society. I'll also make the wallet address public so that you know I'm not taking any off the top - no shenanigans are being pulled up in here.

You may ask: "But won't you need like a million people to mine every day in order to make any reasonable amount of money?" To that I say, why be reasonable? Let's get a billion people to use it. Spread the word. Crypto for kitties is coming.
